# Course Management Enhancements for Wolf Goat Pig

## Overview

The course management system has been significantly enhanced to address the issues with hole handicaps and yards for betting simulation mode. The distance/yards information is now crucial for realistic simulation because it directly impacts betting strategies and scoring probabilities.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. **Missing Distance Data**
- **Problem**: Course holes only had par and stroke index, missing crucial distance/yards data
- **Solution**: Enhanced course data structure to include yards for each hole
- **Impact**: Enables distance-based betting strategy and realistic simulation

### 2. **Limited Hole Information**
- **Problem**: Holes lacked descriptive information and proper structure
- **Solution**: Added hole descriptions, proper numbering, and comprehensive metadata
- **Impact**: Better course visualization and strategic planning
`
### 3. **Inadequate Simulation Factors**
- **Problem**: Simulation didn't account for hole distance in scoring probabilities
- **Solution**: Integrated distance factors into difficulty calculations and score simulation
- **Impact**: More realistic simulation results that reflect real golf scoring patterns

## Enhanced Features

### 1. **Comprehensive Course Data Structure**

```python
# Before (limited data)
{"stroke_index": 5, "par": 4}

# After (complete data)
{
    "hole_number": 1,
    "stroke_index": 5, 
    "par": 4,
    "yards": 420,
    "description": "Dogleg right with water on right"
}
```

### 2. **Distance-Aware Difficulty Calculation**

The system now calculates hole difficulty using both stroke index and distance:

```python
def get_hole_difficulty_factor(self, hole_number):
    stroke_index = self.hole_stroke_indexes[hole_idx]
    stroke_difficulty = (19 - stroke_index) / 18  # 0-1 scale
    
    # Distance factor based on expected yards for par
    expected_yards = {3: 150, 4: 400, 5: 550}
    yard_difficulty = yards / expected_yards.get(par, 400)
    
    # Combined: 70% stroke index, 30% distance
    return 0.7 * stroke_difficulty + 0.3 * (yard_difficulty - 0.5)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Course Statistics**

```python
{
    "total_par": 72,
    "total_yards": 7050,
    "par_3_count": 4,
    "par_4_count": 10,
    "par_5_count": 4,
    "average_yards_per_hole": 391.7,
    "longest_hole": {"hole_number": 3, "yards": 580},
    "shortest_hole": {"hole_number": 17, "yards": 155},
    "difficulty_rating": 8.2
}
```

### 4. **Simulation Integration**

Distance now affects scoring probabilities:

```python
def _simulate_player_score(self, handicap, par, hole_number, game_state):
    # Calculate distance factor
    distance_factor = yards / expected_yards
    distance_adjustment = 1.0 / distance_factor if distance_factor > 1.0 else distance_factor
    
    # Apply to probabilities
    prob_birdie *= distance_adjustment
    prob_par *= distance_adjustment
    
    # Longer holes increase bogey/double chances
    if distance_factor > 1.1:
        prob_bogey *= distance_factor * 0.8
        prob_double *= distance_factor * 0.6
```

## API Enhancements

### New Endpoints

1. **POST /courses** - Create course with full validation
2. **PUT /courses/{name}** - Update existing course
3. **DELETE /courses/{name}** - Delete course with fallback handling
4. **GET /courses/{name}/stats** - Get comprehensive course statistics
5. **GET /courses/{course1}/compare/{course2}** - Compare two courses
6. **GET /game/current-hole** - Get detailed current hole information

### Enhanced Validation

```python
class HoleInfo(BaseModel):
    hole_number: int
    par: int
    yards: int
    handicap: int  # Stroke index (1-18)
    description: Optional[str] = None
    
    @validator('par')
    def validate_par(cls, v):
        if not 3 <= v <= 6:
            raise ValueError('Par must be between 3 and 6')
        return v
    
    @validator('yards')
    def validate_yards(cls, v):
        if v < 100:
            raise ValueError('Yards must be at least 100')
        return v
```

## Course Data Examples

### Wing Point Course
- **Total Par**: 72
- **Total Yards**: 7,050
- **Longest Hole**: #3 (580 yards, Par 5)
- **Shortest Hole**: #17 (155 yards, Par 3)
- **Difficulty Range**: Easy par 3s to challenging long par 4s

### Championship Links
- **Total Par**: 72  
- **Total Yards**: 8,895
- **Longest Hole**: #18 (655 yards)
- **Shortest Hole**: #1 (350 yards)
- **Profile**: Longer, more challenging course

## Impact on Betting Simulation

### 1. **Distance-Based Strategy**
- **Short Holes (< 350 yards)**: Favor putting skills, lower scoring variance
- **Medium Holes (350-450 yards)**: Balanced skill requirements
- **Long Holes (> 450 yards)**: Favor driving distance, higher variance

### 2. **Handicap Considerations**
- **High Handicappers**: Struggle more on long holes, benefit from shorter courses
- **Low Handicappers**: More consistent across all distances
- **Course Selection**: Strategic advantage for players suited to specific course types

### 3. **Betting Probability Adjustments**
- **Long Par 4s (> 430 yards)**: Increased bogey probability for all players
- **Short Par 3s (< 160 yards)**: Higher birdie probability, putting becomes critical
- **Reachable Par 5s (< 530 yards)**: Eagle opportunities for low handicappers
