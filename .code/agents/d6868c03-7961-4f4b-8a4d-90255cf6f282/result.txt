Cloud task completed: task_e_68f7a39605e88330b21442be578dafce

Prompt:
Context: Repo: Wolf Goat Pig. Key files: backend/app/main.py (CORS, require_admin, simulation routes), frontend/src/hooks/useSimulationApi.js (uses REACT_APP_API_URL), frontend/package.json (proxy). Goal: produce the most straightforward process to boot both services and create/play a local Simulation game without “Not allowed” errors.

Agent: We’re running Wolf Goat Pig locally (FastAPI backend + React frontend) and want the Simulation UI to work end-to-end. Recent tests show the backend responds, but the UI still shows “Not allowed” when creating a game, likely due to CORS/env configuration or the frontend pointing to the wrong base URL. Please investigate the minimal steps (env vars, start scripts, proxy/REACT_APP_API_URL, admin headers) to make local Simulation mode work smoothly and document a simple checklist for future runs.

Assistant Messages:
1. ### Summary of what’s going on
* The FastAPI app already enables CORS for the local React dev servers whenever `ENVIRONMENT` is anything other than `production`, so as long as your backend loads a `.env` (or shell exports) with `ENVIRONMENT=development`, requests from `http://localhost:3000`/`http://127.0.0.1:3000` are accepted.

2. * The simulation endpoints (`/simulation/setup`, `/simulation/play-next-shot`, `/simulation/play-hole`, etc.) do not require any admin headers—only JSON bodies that match the expected payload—so a 403/“Not allowed” response is usually caused by the frontend calling the wrong base URL or a CORS preflight failure.

3. * The React code reads `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` (falling back to an empty string) in both the simulation hook and the setup screen. If that variable is blank, requests are sent relative to the current origin; if it points at the wrong host you’ll see the “Not allowed” symptom.

4. * During `npm start`, CRA’s proxy forwards relative requests to `http://localhost:8000`, but production or non-proxied builds require `REACT_APP_API_URL` to be populated explicitly.

5. ### Minimal startup & play checklist (no more “Not allowed”)
1. **Lay down shared environment files**
   * Copy the root `.env.example` to `.env` and keep the local defaults (`ENVIRONMENT=development`, `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`, `WGP_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`). This keeps configuration DRY and avoids hard-coding URLs in scripts.

6. * Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` (or export the same values in your shell) so FastAPI knows it is in development mode and uses SQLite locally.

7. * Create `frontend/.env.local` containing `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` (and any mock toggles you want). That forces both the hook and the setup screen to talk to the live backend even when the proxy is bypassed.

8. 2. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Load environment (if you didn’t use a process manager that auto-loads .env)
   export $(grep -v '^#' ../.env | xargs)  # or use direnv/foreman for better management
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```
   * Browse to `http://localhost:8000/docs` and test `POST /simulation/setup` with a sample four-player payload to confirm the endpoint responds with 200 before touching the UI.

9. 3. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   * CRA will proxy API calls to `http://localhost:8000` automatically thanks to `package.json`, but the `.env.local` guard keeps you safe if you ever serve a production build from a different origin.

10. 4. **Create and play a simulation game**
   * Visit `http://localhost:3000`, open Simulation Mode, pick a course and three computer opponents, then click Start. The first call hits `POST /simulation/setup`; subsequent buttons call `/simulation/play-next-shot` or `/simulation/play-hole`. Because the backend accepts the local origin, you should no longer see “Not allowed.”

5. **Quick diagnostics if something regresses**
   * Run `curl -i http://localhost:8000/healthz` to ensure the API is reachable.
   * Inspect the browser’s Network tab—if requests are trying to reach `http://localhost:3000/simulation/...` in a production build, your `REACT_APP_API_URL` was not picked up.
   * Verify the console shows the correct `ENVIRONMENT` during startup (FastAPI logs it on boot).

11. ### Recommendations for better long-term ergonomics
* The base API URL is redeclared in multiple React files; consider exporting `simulationConfig.apiUrl` everywhere instead of repeating `const API_URL = ...` to stay DRY and avoid drift when you tweak env handling.

12. * Adopt a single dotenv loader (e.g., `python-dotenv`, `direnv`, or a process manager) so the backend never boots without the `.env` values that relax CORS in development. That eliminates flaky “Not allowed” errors caused by missing environment variables.
* If you routinely switch between local and remote APIs, define `REACT_APP_API_URL` variants in `.env.development.local` / `.env.production.local` to prevent accidental commits and keep configuration centralized (per your DRY guideline).

13. I’ll follow the read-only mode and search for AGENTS, without making any changes.

14. I need to locate the AGENTS.md file for guidance.

15. I need to review the files, focusing on minimal steps to run backend and front.

16. I need to review the `require_admin` and `simulation` endpoints for the admin header.

17. I wonder if I should look for `require_admin` in another file; using `rg` now.

18. I think `require_admin` might be defined inside `main`. I'll search for `admin_email`.

19. I need to locate the portion relevant to simulation creation. Maybe an admin function required.

20. I need to check the setup function around line 4270 to confirm the admin header requirement.

21. No admin needed for setup. I'll check for CORS errors or incorrect base URL by inspecting `useSimulationApi.js`.

22. I'll confirm if `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set to adjust fetch calls, and check for a proxy.

23. The "Not allowed" error could be related to missing admin permissions. I need to confirm why.

24. I think the "Not allowed" error could be related to the wrong backend route or admin access.

25. I wonder if the message is from the backend. Let me check the simulation UI.

26. I don't see an AGENTS.md, but I'll focus on hooking instead. Checking components now.

27. I need to look at the `GameSetup.tsx` file to understand its API usage.

28. I'll search for `@app.get("/courses")` to review backend endpoint access.

29. I need to verify if the `/courses` endpoint requires admin access.

30. It seems like the CORS issue might come from the API URL or backend headers. I'll inspect the `.env` settings for `REACT_APP_API_URL` and ensure the dev server is using the correct origin.

31. I'll check the root directory for the .env file.

32. I need to check the `.env.example` file for relevant details.

33. I need the backend environment file, like `backend/.env.example`.

34. I need to check `frontend/src/config` to verify the `.env` settings for the API.

35. I need to verify if using POST instead of GET resolves the "Not allowed" issue.

36. I’ll look for the `setupSimulation` function to find where the simulation starts.

37. I'm going to search for `useSimulationApi` to confirm the hook in SimulationMode.

38. I think `SimulationMode` might be using context hooking to trigger fetch calls. Let's search `simulation/play-hole`.

39. I'll review `SimulationMode.js` and the use of `SIMULATION_API_URL` and surrounding logic.

40. I need to see if there's a `dev.sh` file around here.

41. I need to gather info to boot both services and troubleshoot the "Not allowed" error.

42. I suspect the error arises from hitting the wrong endpoint with a GET instead of POST.

43. Hmm, could "Not allowed" be coming from a CORS preflight? Time to check the repo.

44. Hmm, could the error be related to the network? Maybe the 403 message needs proper parsing. I'll check if it's a result of cross-domain issues between frontend and backend. Need to verify backend setup.

45. I need to start the backend—checking dependencies in `backend/requirements.txt` before proceeding.

46. I need to gather lines from `backend/app/main.py` and ensure proper environment variable usage.

I'll search the frontend for where "Not allowed" is displayed in the UI.

47. The issue might be from a "Method Not Allowed" error due to a wrong method.

48. I need to review environment settings and API URL setup across frontend and backend.

49. I need to compile line references for specifics like CORS origins, then outline step-by-step instructions.

50. I need to gather lines from the `main.py` file for the simulation setup endpoint.

51. I need to reference `useSimulationApi` and its connection to `process.env` using `nl -ba`.

52. I'll get the line ranges for `GameSetup.tsx` mentioning fetch to courses, personalities, etc.

53. I'll use `nl -ba` to list relevant lines from `frontend/package.json` for proxy.

54. I'll use `nl -ba` to number lines in `.env.example` and suggest environment variables.

55. I'll provide a simple guide for setting up `.env` files for frontend/backend, environment variables, and instructions for avoiding proxy issues. I'll emphasize starting the backend with `uvicorn` in dev mode and using `npm start` for the frontend. I'll mention simulating game steps and keeping configuration consistent using `.env`.

I'll clarify setup steps: configure `.env`, install dependencies, and start backend/frontend. Mention `REACT_APP_API_URL` and ensure correct environment variable settings to avoid CORS issues.

If `ENVIRONMENT` is unset, it defaults to `None`, allowing localhost. Still, it's safer to set it to `development`.

56. I'm looking to locate the `@app.post("/wgp/start-game")` handler in the code.

57. To ensure smooth setup, I'll create an easy-to-follow checklist with environment and config steps.

I'll organize the findings, checklist, and recommendations in Markdown with citations and troubleshooting tips.

I'll form a clean checklist in Markdown, highlight relevant behavior, and provide helpful troubleshooting steps.
