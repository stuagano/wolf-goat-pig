Feature: Simulation betting mechanics # tests/bdd/behave/features/simulation_betting.feature:1
  Wolf Goat Pig betting involves progressive wagering with doubles, carries, and special rules.
  These scenarios exercise the reusable seeding DSL for betting-related state.

Feature: Simulation service health checks # tests/bdd/behave/features/simulation_health.feature:1
  The Wolf Goat Pig platform needs high-level functional signals so stakeholders can express
  expectations in plain English. These Gherkin scenarios can be generated collaboratively with the AI agent
  from conversational requirements and then executed automatically.

  Scenario: Duplicate player assignment is reflected in team state  # tests/bdd/behave/features/simulation_partnership.feature:279
    Given the simulation API is available                           # None
    And a simulation is set up with the following players           # None
      | id   | name       | handicap | is_human |
      | p1   | Captain    | 10       | true     |
      | bot1 | Computer 1 | 12       | false    |
      | bot2 | Computer 2 | 14       | false    |
      | bot3 | Computer 3 | 8        | false    |
    Given the simulation is at hole 6                               # None
    When I seed the team formation with                             # None
      | type    | partners               |
      | captain | p1                     |
      | team1   | ["p1", "bot1"]         |
      | team2   | ["p1", "bot2", "bot3"] |
    Then the simulation state contains                              # None
      | team_formation.team1 | ["p1", "bot1"]         |
      | team_formation.team2 | ["p1", "bot2", "bot3"] |
