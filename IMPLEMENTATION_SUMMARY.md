## 🎮 Game Rules Implemented

### ✅ Basic Game Structure (4, 5, 6 Players)
- Random hitting order determination ("tossing tees")
- Order rotation each hole (2nd becomes 1st, etc.)
- Captain selection and partnership dynamics
- Aardvark roles and team joining mechanics
- Best ball scoring within teams

### ✅ Player Roles and Responsibilities
- **Captain**: First in order, requests partners or goes solo
- **Aardvark**: 5th/6th players, can join teams or go solo
- **Goat**: Player furthest down, chooses position in Hoepfinger
- **Invisible Aardvark**: 4-man game special mechanic

### ✅ Team Formation Mechanics
- Partnership requests with eligibility rules
- Accept/decline responses with automatic fallbacks
- Aardvark team joining with rejection ("tossing") mechanics
- Solo play options for both Captain and Aardvark
- Complex 6-man game team structures

### ✅ Betting Conventions
- **Base Wagering**: Quarter-based system with multipliers
- **The Float**: Captain doubles base wager (once per round)
- **The Option**: Auto-double when Captain is furthest down
- **Doubles**: Team-based doubling with acceptance/decline
- **The Duncan**: Captain solo with 3-for-2 payout
- **The Tunkarri**: Aardvark solo with 3-for-2 payout
- **Ackerley's Gambit**: Team member opt-out mechanics
- **Line of Scrimmage**: Betting restrictions based on ball position
- **Carry-Over**: Halved holes double next hole's wager

### ✅ Special Game Phases
- **Regular Play**: Standard hole-by-hole progression
- **Vinnie's Variation**: Holes 13-16 in 4-man (double base bet)
- **Hoepfinger Phase**: Final holes with Goat choosing position
- **Joe's Special**: Goat sets hole values (2, 4, or 8 quarters)

### ✅ Advanced Rules and Edge Cases
- **Karl Marx Rule**: Fair point distribution based on standings
- **Hanging Chad**: Tied player score resolution delays
- **Change of Mind**: Action finality rules
- **Good But Not In**: Concession without betting closure
- **Ping Ponging**: Aardvark rejection mechanics
- **Double Points Rounds**: Major championship multipliers
