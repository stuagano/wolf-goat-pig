## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Captain Partnership Decisions
**Given** a player is the Captain on a hole  
**When** they see each opponent's tee shot in order  
**Then** they can make informed partnership invitations following "after tee shot, before next" rules

### Scenario 2: Mid-Hole Betting Strategy
**Given** teams are formed and shots are being played in match play order  
**When** a strategic advantage develops (e.g., opponent in trouble)  
**Then** players can offer doubles following Line of Scrimmage and "in the hole" rules

### Scenario 3: Turn-Based Decision Flow
**Given** a partnership invitation or double offer is made  
**When** the receiving player must make a decision  
**Then** the game waits for their response before continuing, with betting implications applied correctly
