# User Story 001: Fix TypeScript/ESLint Errors

## Story Overview
**Title**: Resolve TypeScript and ESLint errors in frontend components
**Epic**: Technical Debt & Code Quality
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 5
**Assignee**: TBD
**Status**: Ready for Development

## User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** all TypeScript and ESLint errors resolved in frontend components
**So that** the codebase maintains high quality standards and prevents runtime errors

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: TypeScript Compliance
- [ ] All `.ts` and `.tsx` files compile without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Proper type definitions for all props and state variables
- [ ] No usage of `any` type without explicit justification
- [ ] All imported modules have correct type definitions

### AC-002: ESLint Rule Compliance
- [ ] All ESLint warnings and errors are resolved
- [ ] Code follows established linting rules for React/TypeScript
- [ ] No unused variables or imports remain
- [ ] Consistent code formatting across all files

### AC-003: Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Component props are properly typed with interfaces
- [ ] Event handlers have correct type signatures
- [ ] API response types are properly defined
- [ ] Null/undefined checks are implemented where necessary

### AC-004: Build Process
- [ ] `npm run build` completes without errors or warnings
- [ ] Development server starts without console errors
- [ ] All components render without runtime type errors

## Technical Notes

### Current Known Issues
- Review console errors in browser development tools
- Check for any broken import paths after recent restructuring
- Validate component prop types and interfaces
- Ensure API call response types are properly defined

### Implementation Details
- Focus on components in `/src/components/` directory
- Pay special attention to simulation components that were recently refactored
- Use TypeScript strict mode to catch potential issues
- Implement proper error boundaries where appropriate

### Dependencies
- Review and update `@types/*` packages if needed
- Ensure ESLint configuration is up to date
- Consider upgrading TypeScript version if beneficial

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] All fixed components maintain existing functionality
- [ ] New type definitions don't break existing tests
- [ ] Add tests for any newly typed components

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Components integrate correctly with TypeScript changes
- [ ] No regression in component interactions
- [ ] API calls continue to work with new type definitions

### Manual Testing
- [ ] All components render correctly in browser
- [ ] No console errors during normal usage
- [ ] Form submissions and user interactions work as expected

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All ESLint warnings resolved
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] No console errors in development mode
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated for any API changes
- [ ] All tests pass

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: Low
**Mitigation**: 
- Make incremental changes to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Test thoroughly after each component fix
- Have rollback plan if major issues arise

## Notes
- This work will improve overall code quality and developer experience
- Should reduce debugging time and prevent future runtime errors
- Consider this a prerequisite for other frontend enhancements
