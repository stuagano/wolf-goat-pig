- preferences (JSON: AI difficulty, game modes, etc.)

Player_Statistics:
- player_id, games_played, games_won, total_earnings
- avg_earnings_per_hole, betting_success_rate
- favorite_game_mode, preferred_player_count

Game_Player_Results:
- game_id, player_id, final_position, earnings
- holes_won, successful_bets, partnership_success
```
