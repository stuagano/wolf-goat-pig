## 4. Technical Implementation

### Blockchain Infrastructure

#### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
// ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard (gas-efficient for multiple badge types)
contract WolfGoatPigBadges is ERC1155, Ownable {

    // Badge metadata
    struct Badge {
        string name;
        string description;
        string rarity;
        uint256 maxSupply;
        uint256 currentSupply;
        string ipfsHash;  // Metadata URI
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Badge) public badges;
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public playerBadges;

    // Minting function (only called by backend API)
    function mintBadge(address player, uint256 badgeId) external onlyOwner {
        require(badges[badgeId].currentSupply < badges[badgeId].maxSupply, "Max supply reached");
        _mint(player, badgeId, 1, "");
        badges[badgeId].currentSupply++;
    }

    // Burn for upgrades (trade 3 common for 1 rare)
    function upgradeBadges(uint256[] memory burnIds, uint256 mintId) external {
        // Implementation for badge crafting system
    }
}
```

#### Deployment Plan
1. **Testnet:** Deploy to Polygon Mumbai (free testing)
2. **Mainnet:** Deploy to Polygon PoS ($0.01 per mint vs $50+ on Ethereum)
3. **IPFS:** Host badge artwork and metadata on IPFS/Arweave (decentralized)
4. **OpenSea:** Auto-list on OpenSea using their metadata standards

    const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
    const signer = await provider.getSigner();
    const address = await signer.getAddress();
    return { provider, signer, address };
  }
  throw new Error("MetaMask not installed");
};

export const mintBadge = async (badgeId, playerAddress) => {
  const { signer } = await connectWallet();
