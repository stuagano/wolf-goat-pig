# Enhanced Wolf Goat Pig Features

## 🎯 Shot Progression & Betting Analysis

The Wolf Goat Pig simulation has been enhanced with advanced shot-by-shot progression and real-time betting analysis features, similar to the original `simulation.py` but specifically designed for the complex Wolf Goat Pig betting rules.

## 🆕 New Features Added

### 1. **Shot-by-Shot Progression Mode**
- **Enable via UI**: Click "🎯 Enable Shot Progression" button in the WGP game
- **Real-time shots**: Simulate individual shots for each player in order
- **Shot tracking**: Monitor distance to pin, lie type, and shot quality
- **Visual progress**: See each player's shot history for the current hole

### 2. **Dynamic Betting Opportunities**
Just like poker betting rounds, the system now identifies optimal betting moments:

#### **Automatic Detection:**
- **💎 Excellent shots**: "Perfect time to double!" - Low risk recommendation
- **😬 Terrible shots**: "Your team has the advantage!" - Medium risk opportunity  
- **🎯 Close to pin**: Strategic doubling when players are within 20ft
- **🎲 Random opportunities**: 25% chance for general betting moments

#### **Smart Recommendations:**
- **Recommended action**: System suggests best betting decision
- **Risk assessment**: Low/Medium/High risk evaluation
- **Probability analysis**: Win probability and confidence calculations

### 3. **Comprehensive Betting Analysis**

#### **Shot Impact Assessment:**
- **Quality rating**: Excellent/Good/Average/Poor/Terrible
- **Distance analysis**: Remaining distance to pin
- **Strategic value**: High/Low based on position
- **Hole control**: Whether momentum was gained/lost

#### **Strategic Recommendations:**
- **🎯 Immediate doubling**: When excellent shots provide strong advantage
- **🛡️ Cautious approach**: When opponent errors create opportunity
- **🥅 Scoring position**: Close-to-pin doubling opportunities

#### **Computer Player Analysis:**
- **Personality insights**: Aggressive/Conservative/Balanced/Strategic
- **Betting tendencies**: How each computer player typically behaves
- **Double acceptance**: Likelihood of accepting/declining doubles

#### **Team Position Analysis:**
- **Current wager**: Live quarter amounts
- **Potential doubles**: What stakes would become if doubled
- **Momentum tracking**: Positive/negative based on recent shots

### 4. **Mid-Hole Betting Choices**
Unlike simple end-of-hole scoring, players now get betting opportunities throughout hole play:

- **Offer Double**: When system detects favorable conditions
- **Wait**: Strategic patience option
- **Pass**: Conservative approach
- **Real-time decisions**: Based on shot-by-shot developments

## 🎮 How It Works

### **For Human Players:**
1. **Start game normally** with mix of human/computer players
2. **Complete team formation** (partnerships, solo decisions)
3. **Enable shot progression** via the UI button
4. **Hit shots one by one** - system simulates realistic golf shots
5. **Receive betting opportunities** when shots create favorable/unfavorable conditions
6. **Get strategic analysis** explaining why betting decisions make sense
7. **Make informed decisions** with computer player tendency insights

### **For Computer Players:**
- **Automatic decisions**: Computers make betting choices based on their personalities
- **Realistic behavior**: Aggressive players double more, conservative players are selective
- **Strategic analysis**: System reveals computer tendencies to human players

## 🏌️ Shot Simulation Features

### **Realistic Golf Physics:**
- **Lie progression**: Tee → Fairway/Rough → Green based on shot quality
- **Distance reduction**: Each shot reduces distance to pin realistically
- **Handicap influence**: Lower handicap players hit better shots more often
- **Environmental factors**: Lie type affects shot difficulty

### **Shot Quality Factors:**
- **Player skill**: Based on handicap rating
- **Lie difficulty**: Tee (0.9) → Fairway (1.0) → Rough (0.7) → Bunker (0.5)
- **Random variation**: Realistic shot outcome distribution
- **Hole completion**: Players hole out or reach maximum shots

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### **New Data Structures:**
```python
@dataclass
class WGPShotResult:
    player_id: str
    shot_number: int
    lie_type: str  # "tee", "fairway", "rough", "bunker", "green"
    distance_to_pin: float
    shot_quality: str  # "excellent", "good", "average", "poor", "terrible"
    made_shot: bool = False

@dataclass  
class WGPBettingOpportunity:
    opportunity_type: str  # "double", "strategic", "partnership_change"
    message: str
    options: List[str]
    probability_analysis: Dict[str, float]
    recommended_action: str
    risk_assessment: str  # "low", "medium", "high"
```

### **New API Endpoints:**
- **POST /wgp/enable-shot-progression**: Enable shot-by-shot mode
- **POST /wgp/simulate-shot**: Simulate individual player shot
- **GET /wgp/hole-progression**: Get current hole progression state

### **Enhanced Frontend Components:**
- **Shot progression interface**: Live shot tracking and controls
- **Betting opportunity alerts**: Prominent betting decision prompts
- **Analysis dashboard**: Strategic recommendations and insights
- **Computer player insights**: Personality and tendency analysis
