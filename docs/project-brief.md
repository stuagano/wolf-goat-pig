## Development Methodology

### BMad Method Implementation
The project follows the BMad Method for agile AI-driven development:
- **Structured Documentation**: PRD, Architecture, Tech Stack, Coding Standards
- **User Stories**: Prioritized backlog in docs/stories/
- **Agent System**: Architect, PM, QA, Dev agents for consistency
- **Deployment Automation**: Validation scripts and CI/CD

### Quality Assurance
- 68/136 backend tests passing (infrastructure stable)
- Frontend builds successfully with minimal warnings
- BDD scenarios for critical flows
- Deployment validation scripts

## Deployment & Operations

### Production Environment
- **Backend URL**: https://wolf-goat-pig-api.onrender.com
