### Key Game Mechanics Implemented

#### Player Roles
- **Captain** üëë: First player in hitting order each hole
- **Aardvark** üêò: 5th/6th players in 5/6-man games
- **Goat** üêê: Player furthest down in points

- **Aardvark Dynamics**: Request to join teams or go solo
- **Team Tossing**: Rejection mechanics with wager doubling

#### Betting Conventions
- **Base Wagering**: Quarter-based betting system
- **The Float** üèÉ: Captain can double base wager (once per round)
- **The Option** ‚ö°: Auto-double when Captain is furthest down
- **Doubles**: Team-based doubling with acceptance/decline
- **Karl Marx Rule**: Fair point distribution based on standings

#### Special Rules
- **The Duncan** üëë: Captain solo with 3-for-2 payout
- **The Tunkarri** üêò: Aardvark solo with 3-for-2 payout
- **Ackerley's Gambit**: Team member opt-out mechanics
- **Line of Scrimmage**: Betting restrictions based on ball position
- **Carry-Over**: Halved holes double next hole's wager

#### Game Phases
- **Regular Play**: Standard hole-by-hole progression
- **Vinnie's Variation**: Holes 13-16 in 4-man (double base bet)
- **Hoepfinger Phase**: Final holes with Goat choosing position
- **Joe's Special**: Goat sets hole values (2, 4, or 8 quarters)

## üéÆ Game Rules Summary

### Basic Game Structure
1. **Random Hitting Order**: Determined by "tossing tees" on first hole
2. **Rotation**: Order rotates each hole (2nd becomes 1st, etc.)
3. **Captain Decision**: First player chooses partner or goes solo
4. **Aardvark Actions**: 5th/6th players can join teams or go solo
5. **Scoring**: Best ball within teams, points distributed via Karl Marx Rule

### Special Phases
- **Holes 13-16 (4-man)**: Vinnie's Variation - double base wager
- **Final Holes**: Hoepfinger phase - Goat chooses hitting position
- **Joe's Special**: Hoepfinger hole values set by Goat

### Betting Rules
- **Base**: 1 quarter per hole (2 on major championship days)
- **Multipliers**: Float, Option, doubles, solo play
- **Restrictions**: Line of Scrimmage, balls in hole
- **Distribution**: Karl Marx Rule for fair point allocation
