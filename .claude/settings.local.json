Static assets (/static/*) served directly\n2. Common files (manifest, favicon, robots.txt) served directly\n3. File extensions (.css, .js, .png, etc.) served directly\n4. All other routes fall through to index.html for React Router\n\nThis fixes the production deployment MIME type errors.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
