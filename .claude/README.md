## How to Use

### Using Agents

1. **Identify the Problem**: Determine which agent best matches your task
2. **Reference the Agent**: Mention the agent in your conversation
3. **Provide Context**: Give the agent necessary information
4. **Let It Work**: The agent will work autonomously

**Example Conversation**:
```
You: I need to improve test coverage for the backend simulation logic.

Claude: I'll use the test-coverage-agent to analyze your backend test coverage
and generate tests for untested code paths.

[Agent analyzes code, identifies gaps, generates tests]

Claude: I've added 15 new tests for wolf_goat_pig_simulation.py, increasing
coverage from 72% to 94%.
```

### Using Skills

1. **Identify the Task**: Find the skill that matches your needs
2. **Follow the Steps**: Execute the commands in the skill
3. **Verify Results**: Check that the skill completed successfully

**Example**:
```
You: Run all tests to make sure everything works before I commit.

Claude: I'll use the run-all-tests skill to execute the complete test suite.

[Runs backend pytest, frontend Jest, E2E Playwright tests]

Claude: All tests passed!
- Backend: 245 tests, 87% coverage
- Frontend: 89 tests, 81% coverage
- E2E: 31 tests, all passing
```
