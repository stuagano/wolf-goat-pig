Wolf Goat Pig Golf Game RulesCore ConceptsObjective: Players wager quarters on each hole, aiming to win points by having the best ball score within their team or as an individual.Players: 4, 5, or 6 players.Wagering Unit: Typically quarters ($0.25), though can be doubled.Game Flow:Determine hitting order for the hole.Captain (and potentially Aardvark(s)) determines teams or decides to go solo.Players hit their shots according to Order of Play (furthest from the hole hits next).Wagering (Doubles, Carry-Overs) can occur.Hole is completed, scores are compared, and points are distributed.Repeat for subsequent holes, with rotating roles.Transition to Hoepfinger phase towards the end of the round.Player Roles and Team Formation4-Man GamePlayers: 4Initial Hitting Order: Randomly determined.Captain: The player hitting first.Action: May request one partner for that hole to play best ball.Partner Ineligibility: A player cannot be requested as a partner once the next player in order has hit their shot. The 4th player is eligible until the first "second" shot is struck.No Partner Requested: Captain goes solo, playing against the best ball of the other three players.Partner Rejection: If a requested player declines, they go solo, playing against the best ball of the other three.Invisible Aardvark: Exists only in the 4-man game.Action: Automatically asks to join the team that was forcibly formed (when Captain goes solo or is rejected). Records no score but affects betting.Tossing the Invisible Aardvark: See Betting Conventions.Rotation:Hole 1: Random.Subsequent Holes: Player who hit second on the previous hole becomes Captain. Third becomes second, fourth becomes third, and the previous Captain moves to fourth.Solo Requirement: Each player must go solo at least once in the first 16 holes (before the Hoepfinger).5-Man GamePlayers: 5Initial Hitting Order: Randomly determined.Captain: The player hitting first.Action: May request a partnership with one of players #2-4.Aardvark: The fifth player in the rotation.Action (after Captain's partnership is set): May request to join one of the two formed teams (to make it 2 players vs. 3 players).Request Timing: Must be made prior to the first second shot being struck.Rejection by Solicited Team: If rejected, the Aardvark automatically joins the other team, and the point risk for players on that team (the one the Aardvark was "tossed" to) is doubled. The original soliciting team faces triple risk (3 * 2 = 6 points total, divided by 2 players = 3 points per player)."Going It Alone" Option: The Aardvark can choose to play their ball against the best ball of each of the two other teams. The two other teams also compete against each other in straight best ball.Solo Option (Non-Aardvark): One of the first four players can go "on their own," leading to a one-on-one-on-three game.Rotation:Holes 1-15: Standard rotation (player who hit second becomes first, etc.). Equal rotation after 15 holes.Hole 16: Low point-getter chooses their hitting spot in the rotation.Holes 17 & 18: Recalculated low point-getter chooses their hitting spot.6-Man GamePlayers: 6Initial Hitting Order: Randomly determined.Captain: The player hitting first.Action: May request a partnership with one of the top four hitters."Going It Alone" Option: If the Captain goes solo, players 2-4 form Team B, and 5 & 6 become Team C.Second Captain: The first player in the order not selected by the original Captain.Action: Can select any of the remaining players as a partner. Has the option to "go it alone."First Aardvark: Player #5 in the rotation.Action: Must settle which team they are on before the Second Aardvark inquires. May ask to join a team or go solo.Second Aardvark: Player #6 in the rotation.Action: May ask to join a team or go solo.Aardvark Tossing (General): If an Aardvark is asked to join a team and is "tossed" (denied), they automatically go to the other team(s). If more than two teams, and tossed by first choice, they choose between remaining teams.Rotation: Not explicitly defined, but generally follows the pattern of the 5-man game regarding low-point getter choosing their spot later in the round.Game Actions and RulesChange of Mind: Player's answer to a request (e.g., double, partnership) is final upon the start of the next "game-action" (player addressing ball, next offer).Order of Play:Tee Box: Follows the determined rotation.Fairway/Green: Strict Match Play format â€“ player furthest from the hole hits next.Invitation: Captain and/or Aardvark(s) can offer a partnership.Timing: No player may be invited after they have hit their tee shot AND the next shot has been played.Rejection:4-Man Game: If turned down, the player turning it down goes "on his own" against the best ball of the other three. The bet doubles.5-Man Game: If Captain is turned down by a non-Aardvark, similar to 4-man. If Aardvark is turned down, they are "tossed" to the other team.6-Man Game: If Second Aardvark is turned down and more than two teams exist, they choose among the remaining teams.Line of Scrimmage: Prevents unfair advantage from being further up the fairway. No double offer can be made by a player who has passed the ball furthest from the hole. No double can be offered based on information from a player who has passed the line of scrimmage. A properly offered double to a team past the line is valid and must be responded to before the next ball is hit.In the Hole: Once any player has holed a shot, no additional wagering may occur.Concession: A shot or putt can be conceded for speed of play ("that's good, but not in"), but the ball is not "deemed to have rested in the cup" for betting purposes.Betting ConventionsTypical Wager: Starts at one quarter per hole.Double Points Rounds: Base wager is two quarters on PGA Tour Major Championship weekends (Masters, PGA Championship, U.S. Open, Open Championship, Players Championship) and the Annual Banquet day.The Option: If the Captain has lost the most quarters prior to the hole, they can double the wager before any tee shots. If tied for greatest losses, all tied players have this right. It is automatically invoked unless proactively "turned off" by the Captain.The Float (4 & 5-man games): Each player can invoke a "float" once per round during their turn as Captain, increasing the wager.The Duncan: If Captain announces before hitting they are going solo (the Pig), they win 3 quarters for every 2 wagered if they have the best net score.On Your Own: Going solo (by Captain's choice or by turning down a partnership) doubles the base wager.Double: Offer from one team to another to double the stakes.Timing: Can be done anytime after teams are formed, but not when an opponent is addressing the ball.Turned Down: Team offering the double wins the hole by default at the wagered level prior to the offer.Accepted: The team that offered the double cannot offer another double to the same team unless they are "redoubled."No Response: If reasonable time passes, deemed accepted once the next shot is played in proper order.Ackerley's Gambit: If a team is offered a double and cannot agree:Players can "opt out" (relinquish quarters at risk)."Opt-in" players are responsible for the entire doubled bet to the opposing team.The dissenting player's ultimate score still benefits the "opt-in" members of their team.The Carry-Over: If all teams halve a hole, the value of the wager for the next hole doubles from its prior value (before any new Captain's wagers).Restriction: Cannot occur on consecutive holes. If two consecutive holes are halved, only the first one triggers a carry-over doubling.Ping Ponging the Aardvark: A team can "re-toss" an Aardvark (invisible or not) that was tossed to them, doubling the bet again. Cannot toss the same Aardvark twice on the same hole.Tossing the Aardvark:4-Man Game (Invisible): Can be tossed (unless a player goes solo). If tossed by a forcibly formed team before either player on that team hits, they win 3 quarters for every 2 wagered.5-Man Game: If Aardvark is tossed, the wager on the hole is doubled.6-Man Game: If Aardvark is tossed, the tossing team doubles its wager with each of the other teams. (Wager between two teams where neither tossed an Aardvark is not doubled).The Tunkarri (5 & 6-man games): Either Aardvark can declare before the Captain hits their tee shot that they intend to go solo, winning 3 quarters for every 2 wagered if they have the best net score.Karl Marx Rule: For situations where quarters won/lost are not easily divisible (e.g., 3-on-2, 2-man team owes 3 quarters): The player "furthest down" (most losses) pays more to make up the difference. If tied, scorekeeper waits for divergence.Hoepfinger PhaseStart:4-Man: Hole 175-Man: Hole 166-Man: Hole 13Goal: Each player must have played as Captain for their full complement of turns before Hoepfinger begins.The Goat: At the start of each Hoepfinger hole, the player who is "furthest down" (has lost the most points) chooses their hitting spot in the rotation.6-Man Hoepfinger Restriction: A player cannot choose the same hitting spot more than twice in a row.Joe's Special: Determines the base value of each Hoepfinger hole.Action: The Goat may choose the starting value as 2, 4, or 8 quarters."Natural" Start: If the hole's "natural" start (due to carryover) is greater than 8, the Goat can choose that higher number. Otherwise, a Hoepfinger hole cannot be more than 8 quarters (no carryovers or Major weeks alter this).Goat Silence: If the Goat is silent, the hole starts at the greater of two quarters or its natural carryover value.Doubling Restriction: No "doubling" during Joe's Special until all players have hit their tee shots.Invocation Timing: Can first be invoked on Hole 16 (5 & 6-man) or Hole 17 (4-man).Other Rules & TerminologyPigeon: Used in Quorum.Quorum: A player's performance only added to the spreadsheet if at least three Members are playing. If multiple groups, Members can "deputize" Pigeons to reach quorum.Range Finders:Par 3s: Only prior to the first tee shot AND by players immediately before their second shot if they haven't reached the green.General: Gentlemen's agreement not to use them to bypass the Line of Scrimmage rule.Vinnie's Variation (4-man game): Base value of each hole doubles from the 13th tee through the start of the Hoepfinger (Hole 17).The Big Dick (18th Tee): Before hitting off the 18th tee, the player with the most points won can declare they are going solo against the rest of the group, risking all winnings.Acceptance: Other players must unanimously agree.Gambit: A player can proffer a Gambit to cover the bet of a player who doesn't want part of the Big Dick.Separate Game: If remaining players are four or more, they also play a separate game of Wolf Goat Pig.Hanging Chad: When the Karl Marx rule is applicable but impacted players have the same point total, the scorekeeper waits for their scores to diverge before applying the rule.Considerations for Simulation / Functional Unit TestsWhen building a simulation, these rules imply specific game states and transitions. Think about how each rule changes the current game state and what data needs to be tracked.Game State Elements to Track:Player Data:Player ID/NameCurrent total points/quarters won/lostPrevious hole's hitting order positionHas invoked "Float" (Boolean)Has gone "solo" (4-man requirement - count/Boolean)Hole Data:Current hole numberCurrent hitting order (list of player IDs)Current Captain IDCurrent Aardvark(s) ID(s) (if applicable)Current teams formed (list of lists/tuples of player IDs)Current wager base value (quarters)Current wager multipliers (due to doubles, tosses, Vinnie's, etc.)Is it a Double Points Round (Boolean)Is the "Option" invoked (Boolean)Has a "Double" been offered/accepted/redoubled by specific teams (per-team state)Has a "Carry-Over" occurred on the previous hole (Boolean)Is the "Hoepfinger" phase active (Boolean)Was Joe's Special invoked (Boolean), and at what valueHas a player been invited to partner (Boolean, for invitation rule)Has the "Line of Scrimmage" been crossed by players for betting purposes (Boolean, per player)Balls "in play" and their distances to the hole (for Order of Play, Line of Scrimmage)Has a ball been "holed" (Boolean, ends wagering)Probabilities & Randomness:Initial Hitting Order: Random permutation of players.Captain's Choice (Partnership): Can be modeled as a decision, potentially influenced by player skill (if part of simulation).Aardvark's Choice (Joining/Solo): Decision, potentially influenced by team strengths/weaknesses.Rejection of Invitation/Aardvark: Decision, potentially influenced by perceived team strength.Functional Unit Test Scenarios (Examples):Test Case 4-Man Game - Captain Goes Solo:Pre-conditions: 4 players, Hole 1, Player A is Captain.Action: Player A declares "On Your Own."Expected Outcome: Teams are Player A (solo) vs. (Player B, C, D best ball). Base wager doubles. Invisible Aardvark state.Test Case 5-Man Game - Aardvark Rejected & Tossed:Pre-conditions: 5 players, teams A & B formed. Aardvark requests to join Team A.Action: Team A rejects Aardvark.Expected Outcome: Aardvark automatically joins Team B. Point risk for Team B players doubles. Point risk for Team A players triples.Test Case Double Acceptance:Pre-conditions: Teams X and Y formed. Team X offers a Double to Team Y.Action: Team Y accepts the Double.Expected Outcome: Wager for the hole doubles. Team X cannot offer another Double to Team Y until redoubled.Test Case Carry-Over Limitation:Pre-conditions: Hole 2 was halved by all, wager carried over (e.g., to 4 quarters on Hole 3).Action: Hole 3 is also halved by all.Expected Outcome: Wager on Hole 4 remains 4 quarters (no further doubling from carry-over on consecutive holes).Test Case Joe's Special Activation:Pre-conditions: 5-man game, Hole 16. Player X is the Goat (furthest down). Previous hole had a carry-over, making the "natural" start 10 quarters.Action: Player X invokes Joe's Special and chooses 8 quarters.Expected Outcome: Hole starts at 8 quarters. No doubling allowed until all tee shots are hit.Alternative Action: Player X invokes Joe's Special and chooses 10 quarters.Expected Outcome: Hole starts at 10 quarters, as it's the "natural" start greater than 8.
