 WOLF GOAT PIG
“We accept bad golf, but not bad betting”

 

The game of Wolf is widely known amongst avid golfers.  But the game of Wolf Goat Pig is played predominantly at Wing Point Golf & Country Club on Bainbridge Island, WA.  Its Rules are rather intricate, its Betting Conventions are not for the faint of heart, its Concepts have been well-established, while its Protocol is beyond reproach and its Strategies are not universally agreed upon.  The Rules are the rules, the Protocol is how we address each other during the game and the actions we take around the game, the Concepts are to be considered when making decisions, and the Strategies depend upon the whims of the player.

According to golfcoursegurus.com, the rules of “Wolf” can be summed up in a paragraph:

“Wolf is a popular betting game played in a best ball format with each player in the foursome taking turns being the Wolf for a hole. As the Wolf you always tee off first and have three options for the hole: 1. Before teeing off you can go "Lone Wolf" and take on the other three players with the Wolf winning or losing triple the points. 2. After your tee shot you can decide to take on the other three players with the Wolf winning or losing double the points. 3. After hitting your tee shot you watch as each player tees off and try to decide on a partner for the hole. The catch is you have to select your partner after you have seen his tee shot but prior to seeing the next player's tee shot. If you don't like what you see from the first two players you automatically get the third players as your partner. These matches are worth one point or whatever the base bet is.”

But that is NOT Wolf Goat Pig.  Based on a Google search, you will only find Wolf Goat Pig at WPGCC.  Our game is much more intricate, more complicated, and, according to outsiders, more sinister than your common game of Wolf.  Most importantly, it is about banter:  Good ol’ insensitive, thick skinned banter that can only be achieved by those confident in their game and comfortable in their relationship with their fellow players.  Without the banter it’s just golf (which is not so bad, but just so Bushwood).  But with the banter and incessant wagering, it becomes a cult.  So much so that once you learn it well, no other round of golf can bring as much pure joy between players and create the desire to get together and do it again, and again…

HISTORY AND CHARACTERS

The patron saint of our version of Wolf, Goat, Pig is Jon Pettit, and he shall be known for eternity as the Commissioner.  The dashing architect came to the green with the pencil of an accountant and the grin of a dervish as he applied his legalistic bent to the adoption and adaptation of the rules, usually as he saw fit.  It had long been recognized that a certain amount of auditing of the scorekeeping and an advance understanding of the games regulations are need in the balance of the participants to keep Jon from having too much fun with the results.

His steady companions were Bob Silver, Scott Stover, Vince Lanza, Mike Morgan, Terry Fuerst and Bill Ackerley.  The banter of the weekend rounds became such food for the soul that Holiday dinners, championship banquets, weddings, anniversaries and road trips became part of the tradition of the Wolf Goat Pig original contingent.  The game has since grown, the steady companions are identified by their listing on a spreadsheet, and golfers from outside the Membership of the SS, known as pigeons, clamor to play.

There are stories of lore and nicknames to be explained. But these are to be added later.

RULES OF PLAY:  

The basic game of Wolf Goat Pig is for four (4) players. Prior to hitting from the first tee, hitting order is determined randomly (such as tossing a tee). The player selected to go first is not called the wolf, but rather the Captain. He (or she for that matter) may request a partner for that hole to join him in a game of best ball for that hole only. A player becomes ineligible to be requested by the Captain once the next player in order has subsequently hit his shot. Thus, the fourth player in the rotation may be requested up and until the time the first “second” shot has been struck.

If the Captain does not request a partner, then he shall compete with the best ball of the other players for the duration of the hole. A player may turn down the Captain’s request for a partnership, in which case he shall be competing against the best ball of the other three players for the remainder of the hole.

At the second hole, the order of play shall rotate so that the player who hit second on the first tee shall hit first on the second. The third becomes second, the fourth becomes third and the Captain from the prior tee moves to the fourth position.

Note:  In the 4-man game only, each player is required to go solo at least once in the first 16 holes (before the start of the Hoepfinger).

5-man game:  As with the basic game, order is determine at random at the first tee. The first player is the Captain – the fifth player is known as the Aardvark. The Captain may only request a partnership with one of the first four players (#2-4) in the rotation.  Once the teams are aligned amongst the first four players, the Aardvark may request to join one of the two teams to make the competition for that hole two players against three, provided that the request is made prior to the first second shot being struck.

The solicited team (A) may reject the Aardvark’s request, in which case he will automatically join the other team (B) and the point risk to each player on team B shall be doubled (triple risk to team A: 3*2=6 points total in play, divided by the two A players = 3). More drama can be added (see the Ping Pong rule).  The Aardvark also has the option to “go it alone”, thus playing his ball against the best ball of each of the two other teams. Team A and Team B are also competing against each other in straight best ball. It is also possible that one of the first four players has exercised an option to “go it alone”, in which case the game for that hole has become one-on-one-on-three.  In the five-man game, the rotation is equal after 15 holes. Therefore, on the 16th tee the low point-getter gets to select where he wants to hit in the rotation, with the other players falling into their relative spots. On the 17th and 18th tees, once again the recalculated low point-getter gets to choose his spot in the rotation.

6-man Game:  Not many places would permit it, and most foursomes would snicker upon seeing it, but while the five-man game provides some accelerated betting, the six-man game may be the ultimate in on-course fellowship.  And remember this is Wing Point GCC, not Pine Valley.  

The primary difference between the 6-man and 5-man games is that the 6-man game has two Aardvarks.  The first Aardvark (#5 in the rotation) must have settled which team he is on before the second Aardvark is able to inquire about a potential partnership.  

After the random rotation is set, the Captain does his thing, but can only seek partnerships with one of the top four hitters. Once his partnership is solidified, then the first player in the order that was not selected becomes a second Captain, able to select any of the remaining players as a partner. The second Captain has the option of “going it alone” just as the original Captain did. If the original Captain “goes it alone”, then players 2-4 form Team B and 5&6 become Team C (the Captain is team A in this example).

Aardvark – on a given hole, the player to hit fifth or sixth in the order.  The Aardvark may ask to join a team, or go on his own.  A request may be denied (“tossed”) in which case the Aardvark is automatically on (one of) the other team(s).  If there are more than two teams for the Aardvark to choose from on a given hole, and he is tossed by his first choice, he will then choose between the remaining teams as to which he wants to ask next.

Change of Mind:  If a question is asked of a player or team, such as a double or request to join, a player’s answer is final upon the start of the next game-action, such as a player addressing his ball to hit the next shot, or a subsequent offer or request to a different player.

Hanging Chad:  When it is proper to apply the Karl Marx rule, but the players impacted have the same point total, the scorekeeper will keep the score for the two players in limbo until the first moment that their scores diverge from each other.  The postponement of the application is called the “hanging chad” in honor of our country’s year 2000 election process, when the state of Florida had a difficult time evaluating the intent of certain ballots cast in that year’s presidential election.

The Hoepfinger – Once each player has been able to play as the Captain for their full complement of turns, the play enters the Hoepfinger phase of the game.

4-man Game – The Hoepfinger begins on the 17th hole

5-man Game – The Hoepfinger begins on the 16th hole

6-man Game – The Hoepfinger begins on the 13th hole

At the start of each hole of the Hoepfinger, the player who is determined to be the furthest down (the Goat) chooses which spot in the rotation he would like to play from.  However, in the six-man game, a player may not choose to hit from the same spot in the rotation more than twice in a row.  The base value of each hole during the Hoepfinger is determined by the implementation of Joe’s Special.

The Invisible Aardvark – exists only in the 4-man game.  He automatically asks to join the team that was forcibly formed.  He records no score for the hole.  His importance becomes apparent when one studies the Betting Conventions.

The Invitation – the Captain and/or the Aardvark(s) may offer an invitation to another player(s) to join him in a partnership.  No player may be invited after they have hit their tee shot AND the next shot has been played as well.  If the invitation is turned down, then the bet doubles and:

4-man game:  the player turning down the bet will be “on his own” and play his ball against the best ball of the other three players.

5-man game:  when the Captain asks one of the non-Aardvark players, then the result is similar to the 4-man game.  When the Aardvark is turned down upon asking to join one of the two teams formed in front of him, then he is “tossed” to the other team.

6-man game:  when the second Aardvark is turned down, and there are more than two teams to choose from, he may select which of the remaining two teams he would request a partnership with.

The Karl Marx Rule:  there are times when the quarters won or lost on a hole are not easily divisible across all players.  An example of this would be in the 5-man game, a hole that is 3-on-2, the wager never gets past one (quarter), and the hole is lost by the 2-man team.  In this example, the two-man team owes three quarters (one each to the three-man team).  So one player must forfeit two quarters while his partner only loses one.  How to decide?  The utopian philosopher Karl Marx has the answer:  “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.”  In our example, the player that is the furthest down owes only one quarter, the other player two.  If both players happen to be tied heading into the hole in question, then the scorekeeper must wait until one player’s total exceeds the other before assigning that odd quarter.

Line of Scrimmage:  In order to prevent longer hitters, or players in power carts, from an unfair advantage due to being further up the fairway than other players, no offer of a double can be proffered by a player that has passed the line of scrimmage, which is the ball that is furthest from the hole at any given time.  Additionally, a double may not be offered if the player is relying on information from another player who has passed the line of scrimmage, however, if a player does offer a proper double to a team that has passed the line of scrimmage, that offer is valid and must be responded to before the next ball is hit.

Order of Play:  Aside from the rotation of the order of hitting on the tee box, the balance of play shall follow the strict Match Play format as found in the USGA Rules of Golf.  As such, the player who is the furthest from the hole will always hit next.  Once a ball in play has rested in the cup on the green, no further betting may take place.  However, for speed of play, a shot or putt can be conceded at any time by a player’s opponents, yet that ball shall not be deemed to have rested in the cup for betting purposes.  One will most commonly hear a player say to another “that’s good, but not in” to reinforce the protocol that despite the shot being given, betting is still open.

Range Finders:  On par 3s, range finders may only be used prior to the first tee shot AND only by players immediately before playing their second shot if they have yet to reach the green.  It is a gentlemen’s agreement that range finders are not to be used on any hole in order to bypass the Line of Scrimmage rule.

Vinnie’s Variation – in the 4-man game, the base value of each hole is doubled starting on the 13th tee and continuing through the start of the Hoepfinger phase, which will start on the 17th hole in the 4-man game.


BETTING CONVENTIONS:  Wagering

The typical wager begins at one quarter at the start of each hole.  During special weeks, so designated by the Commissioner (traditionally weekends of PGA Tour Major Championships), the base wager may start at two quarters.  That said, the following circumstances can cause the initial wager to be higher:

Ackerley’s Gambit: if a team, when offered a double by their opponents, cannot agree amongst its players whether to accept or not, players may opt it while other(s) opt to stay in.  The player(s) opting to stay in is exercising the Gambit.  The opt-out player(s) relinquishes his quarters at risk prior to the offer of the double to the players that choose to stay in.  The opt in player(s) are then responsible for the entire bet, so as to meet the obligation to the opposing team that comes with accepting the double.  The team that is offering the double is not affected in any manner by a Gambit, except to the extent that play continues on with the traditional elements of the game, including that the dissenting player’s ultimate score shall accrue to the benefit of the “opt in” members of his team.

The Big Dick:  for clarity, this rule is named for Dick Duncan, who despite not being an excessively big man, has a prior rule named for him which invokes his last name; thus, the only choice for this rule, which was inspired by him, must invoke his first name.  The fact that the name seems to describe the ploy is purely coincidental.  Before players hit off the 18th tee, the player who has won the most points to that segment of the round, may declare that he is going on-his-own versus the rest of the group, risking the entire amount of his winnings to that point.  The rest of the players must unanimously agree to accept the Big Dick, however, a player may proffer a Gambit to cover the bet of a player who wants no part of the Big Dick.  In addition to the Big Dick, if the remaining players total four or more, then they will also play a separate game of Wolf, Goat, Pig commensurate with all of its rules and regulations.

The Carry-Over: If a hole is halved by all teams, it is deemed to be “carried-over”, which doubles the value of whatever the wager was on the prior hole before anyone hit a shot.  Example:  on the 2nd tee, the Captain invoked his float, starting the wager on the hole at 2 quarters; the 2nd hole was then halved all around, so the wager on the 3rd tee would begin at 4 quarters before any additional wagers might be added by the new Captain.  However, the implementation of the carry-over may not occur on consecutive holes.  Example, extending from the example above, if the 3rd hole is subsequently halved, then the wager on the 4th hole would also begin at 4 quarters before any additional wagers might be added by the 4th hole Captain

Double – the offer from one team to another to double the stakes of the bet on a given hole.  This is the original wager of all wagers.  This can be done at any time once the teams for the hole have been formed.  However, a double may not be offered to a team while a member of that team is addressing the ball in preparation for his next shot.  If the offer is turned down, the team offering the double shall win the hole by default at the wagered level immediately prior to the offering of the double.  If the offer is accepted, the team that offered the double may not offer a double again to the same team, unless they have been “redoubled” by that team [akin to the doubling cube in Backgammon].  If no response to a double offer is given, and if a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, then the double is deemed to have been accepted once the next shot is played, provided the shot is played in proper order.

The Duncan – If the Captain announces before he hits that he intends to go on his own (the Pig), then he is able to win 3 quarters for every 2 quarters wagered provided he earns the best net score on the hole.

The Float:  In the 4-man and 5-man game, each player may invoke a “float” once during the round during his turn as Captain.  This is not required, it is simply an opportunity to increase the wager if one is so inclined.

If at First you Do succeed, then try, try again:  On those occasions when the Wolf Goat Pig results of a hole are determined before the players leave the tee box, then the player on the conceding team who is the” furthest down” for the round at that point will select a new player to be his partner in order to play best ball for the remainder of the hole.  The points at risk shall be two, and there can be no further betting or doubling through the finish of the hole.

In the hole:  once any player has holed a shot, no additional wagering may occur.  Thus the importance of the concept of “good but not in.”

Joes’ Special – (further refined by executive order by Commissioner Jeff Green on the 17th hole on 2/5/17, and again in August 2017):  The player furthest down (the Goat) as play moves to the Hoepfinger phase, may determine the starting value at each hole as being either 2, 4, or 8 quarters.  If, by chance, the first hole of the Hoepfinger hole would “naturally” start at a number greater than eight, then the Goat may opt to choose that number as well.  Otherwise, a Hoepfinger hole can never be more than 8 – neither carryovers nor “Major” weeks can alter this stipulation.   If the Goat is silent, and Joe’s special is not invoked, then the Hoepfinger hole shall start at the greater of two quarters or what its natural start would have been if there is any carryover from the prior hole.  Joes Special may first be invoked on hole 16 in the five and six-man game, or hole 17 in the four-man game.  The person “furthest down” determines the starting amount of points for the hole.  There may be no “doubling” during Joe’s Special until all players have hit their tee shots.

Double Points Rounds:  The base bet shall be doubled (two quarters instead of one) on days that the following tournaments are played:  The Masters, The PGA Championship, The U.S. Open, the Open Championship (British), and the Players Championship.  The day of the Annual Banquet shall also be played with the base bet doubled.

On Your Own:  A captain may elect to go on his own, playing his ball against the best ball of his opponents.  This doubles the base wager.  A player may also go on his own by turning down the offer to join the Captain if asked.

The Option:  if the Captain has lost the most quarters prior to the start of the hole, then he has the option to have the wager doubled before any players hit their tee shot.  When two or more players are tied for the greatest losses (something less than zero), each is deemed to have the right to invoke the option.  For speed of play, the option is automatically deemed to be invoked, unless the Captain proactively “turns it off”.

Ping Ponging the Aardvark – a team may turn away (ie, re-toss) an Aardvark, invisible or not, that is tossed to them, which doubles the bet again.  A team may not toss the same Aardvark twice on the same hole.

Quorum:  a player’s performance will be added to the spreadsheet only when at least three Members are playing in the same group.  In those instances where more than three players are present, and more than one group needs to be formed, the present Members may “deputize” certain Pigeons based on their knowledge of the game in order to reach a quorum in each group.

Tossing the Aardvark - 

4-man game:  The only Aardvark is an invisible one.  He may be tossed, except in a situation where a player decides to go on his own; thereby doubling the value of the hole.  If the Invisible Aardvark is tossed by the forcibly formed team before either player on that team has struck a shot, then they are able to win 3 quarters for every two quarters wagered (“3 for 2”).

5-man game:  if the Aardvark is tossed, the wager on the hole is doubled

6-man game: if the Aardvark is tossed, the team which tosses the Aardvark doubles its wager with each of the other teams.  Note:  the wager between two teams in which neither had tossed an Aardvark is not doubled.  This can happen when 3 teams are formed in the 6-man game.

The Tunkarri – In the five or six man game, either Aardvark may declare before the Captain hits his tee shot that he intends to go on his own, then he is able to win 3 quarters for every 2 quarters wagered provided he earns the best net score on the hole.

Protocols:

Acting Commissioner:  the Commissioner Emeritus will always be Jon Pettit.  Additionally, the winner of the Pettit Trophy each year will serve as Acting Commissioner subsequent to his hosting of the Annual Banquet.  In this role, the Commissioner will lead discussion and mitigate disputes – from time to time he will have to interpret the rules of Wolf Goat Pig where more clarity is needed.  These interpretations will serve as executive orders through the balance of his term as Commissioner, and will be voted on at the end of his term as to whether said orders should be permanently imbedded in the official Manual of Wolf Goat Pig.

The Annual Banquet:  an annual banquet shall be hosted by the reigning champion.  At the banquet, our roster of rules will be reviewed.  Any rules proposals (see below) are considered and voted on.  All members in good standing, those that have 20 or more appearances to their credit on the previous year’s spreadsheet, shall vote on whether those member(s) with less than 20 appearances will remain on the spreadsheet for the coming year.  This vote should take place in advance of the banquet, via email and led by current commissioner.  The banquet shall be a potluck, the host shall be provide the entrée and the balance of the members will further contribute to the evening’s delectable fare.

Decorum:  Players are to ask for the privilege of certain things, such as: “Will you be my partner?”, or “Will you accept our double?”  Despite what might be perceived to be a gentlemanly protocol, this decorum masks the dark side of Wolf Goat Pig.  In every other case, it is not forbidden to root against your opponents, provided it is done in good form.  Considerable, but appropriate, banter is a mainstay of our game.  It takes a certain amount of time before a player learns to jest and poke without interrupting either their game of the game of others.  Be careful about seeking advice, and especially careful about accepting unsolicited advice of your opponent on any given hole.  You are likely to be led down the wrong path, especially if it is the Weasel who is offering it.

FTA:  The failure of a player to appear (FTA) after that player has previously committed to play, results in a 10 quarter (spreadsheet) fine of the offender for each player who does appear to play for the said round.  A player may avoid an FTA if he delivers an email to all members of the spreadsheet in advance of 7am on the day in question, informing them of his change of heart.  It should be noted that, save for dire situations such as a call to 911, a player who waits until the day of to renounce his intent to play, shall still be subject to ridicule for being a lame-ass and letting his fellow SS members down.

Good But Not In:  As the game is expected to follow a strict order of play, but the game should not needlessly drag on longer than necessary, an opposing team may deem the next shot, or putt, of a player as “good” (meaning his score for the hole will be recorded as if his next shot went in the hole) “but not in”, meaning any potential wagering on the hole may continue.

Handicaps:  During the official off-season for the updating of handicaps, players shall play to the handicap trend noted on the Handicap site in the Pro Shop that day, less the handicap of the player with the lowest handicap trend (their net handicap for that round).  Players determine individual handicaps by subtracting the lowest player's handicap from that of all players.  Otherwise, the official handicap (not the trend) of the player shall be applied during the official posting season.

The Creecher Feature:  In awarding strokes, the highest (ie, easiest) six handicap holes for each player will be played at one half stroke. For all other holes, full handicap strokes will be awarded.  The application of the ½ stroke rule is known as the Creecher Feature, after Bill Creech who originally suggested the idea. But as in all our WGP rules, there was considerable discussion and nuance was added before the rule was officially adopted in the Winter of 2006.  Let it be recorded that Bill Ackerley is credited with proposing the rule in its final and current form.

Example: Players with net handicaps of 18 and higher will play handicap holes 13-18 at one half stroke (all the par threes and holes 7 and 13). They will play all other handicap holes at their full strokes, plus they will get an additional ½ stroke on two holes for every one stroke that their net handicap exceeds 18.  There is no maximum at which ½ strokes would cease to be awarded.

Example: Players with a net handicap of 10 would play handicap holes 5-10 at one half stroke (holes 1, 18, 5, 14, 6, 15 at WPGCC), then be awarded full strokes on holes 1-4 (holes 3, 11, 9, 16)

Example: Players with a net handicap of 6 or less play their all their “handicap” holes at half strokes

The Pettit Trophy:  the winner of the “spreadsheet” will be awarded the Pettit Trophy, named for our Commissioner Emeritus, Jon Pettit.  Jon Pettit was the original and most prolific winner of the annual spreadsheet contest.  The perpetual trophy will be housed by the most recent winner.  The trophy’s plaque will be updated at the end of each season by the previous season’s winner, and will be done so in advance of the Annual Banquet.

Rules Amendments:  In between Annual Banquets, these rules may be amended in the following manner.  Any spreadsheet member may propose an amendment to the Commissioner.  If the Commissioner deems the proposal worthy of consideration, then the Commissioner shall put the proposal to a vote of all spreadsheet members.  In order for a new rule to be adopted between Banquets, a majority of spreadsheet members must vote in the affirmative. All rule changes/amendments adopted between banquets shall be revisited at the subsequent Banquet for permanent approval.

The Tossing of the Tees:  Before the start of play, a designee tosses tees, one by one, to determine the order of play from the tee throughout the round, up and until the Hoepfinger phase.  The order of play rotates from tee box to tee box.

Quarters:  the quarter, or 25 cent piece, shall be the base unit of currency to determine the value of one betting unit.  To play for a larger base unit would distract from the beauty of the game.

Scorekeeping:  One player shall keep the “point” score for each hole by tracking points won and points lost.  In this manner, the point tally on each hole should always balance to zero.  If it does not, then a mistake in scorekeeping has occurred and will almost always be corrected via thoughtful auditing of the group.

The Spreadsheet:  A spreadsheet will be maintained by a volunteer, who must be a member in good standing.  Said spreadsheet will track quarters won by player and by date, including the performance of pigeons.  Official appearances will also be tracked.  The spreadsheet season shall start the day after the completion of the final round of the Open Championship, and shall end on the day that the final round of the subsequent Open Championship is completed.

Early Departures:  if a player does not complete his round then (1) if ahead at time of departure, quarters are distributed as evenly as possible, Karl Marx rule employed if necessary, or (2) if behind at time of departure, quarters are paid out and spreadsheet score is affected by same negative amount, however (3) if there was a pre-round, unanimous agreement to address a potential early departure, the treatment reflected in that agreement shall take precedent over the rule as written (1) (2) above. 

Concepts:

The Animals:  Wolf Goat Pig is made of players who take on certain characteristics of animals you might find on a farm or in the wild.  Some of the labels make sense, others do not, and none of it matters.  They’re just labels made by people who don’t know any better.  There’s a lesson here for greater humanity, be we digress:

o   The Wolf:  In Wolf Goat Pig, we call this player the Captain… oh well.

o   The Goat:  The player who is the furthest down for the round, or the furthest down on the spreadsheet.

o   The Pig:  a player who decides to play solo on a given hole.

o   The Chicken:  a player who had decided to go alone, but accepts the offer of an Aardvark to join his team, thus he “chickened” out.

o   A Pigeon:  a non-Member who risks all to join the fray.

o   The Weasel:  there is only one…  Enough said.

o   The Elephant:  that player who is clearly not playing to his handicap on a given day, or has it a horrible opening shot on a hole.  Partnerships are avoided with this player, so he becomes the Elephant in the room.

o   The Peacock:  the player who thinks he can never lose, no matter the current circumstances.

o   The Death Star:  ok, not an animal, but an inanimate object that players seem to forget can cause them destruction – the Death Star has been brought to life in recent years by one Scott Stover, a sneaky little gonniff who has mastered the art of the ½ stroke, especially on Par 3s.

·       The Angry Aardvark:  named for that player who, after asking to join a team is unceremoniously denied.  The term is most often invoked when said jilting backfires, and it is the Angry Aardvark who ends up winning the hole.

·       The Captain – the player whose turn it is to hit first on a given hole.  In some circles, this player may be known as the Wolf.  But not in Wolf Goat Pig.

·       Farmer John:  the player or team that talks up a big win, but ultimately doesn’t win the hole due to an unexpected shot by their opponents.

·       A Fuerst:  If a team appears to have proposed a “double” offering in advance of obtaining a clear advantage, that is called committing a Fuerst. Named for a former Tasmanian Daredevil from Michigan who gained notoriety for assuming, prematurely, that he had the upper hand in a game. For example: if team A offers team B a double, team B might say “that’s a Fuerst!” if they believe team A does not have an advantage.  While one Terry Fuerst may have originated this habit, it is Mike Goldsberry who has raised it to another level.

·       History:  The patron saint of Wolf, Goat, Pig is apparently Dale Sperling, who brought the game to Wing Point from some distant land. The sage real estate broker introduced the game to our young architect, the Commissioner Emeritus, Master Jon Pettit, who famously came to the green with the pencil of an accountant and the grin of a dervish as he applied his legalistic bent to the adoption and adaptation of the rules, as he saw fit of course.  His steady companions in the modern game, as defined here, were Bob Silver, Scott Stover, Vince Lanza, Mike Morgan, Terry Fuerst and Bill Ackerley.

·       Members:  there are typically ten Members of the SS (spreadsheet) at any given time, though there can be more, and there can be less, subject to the whims of the sitting Members.

·       Morgan on the Tee: Don’t you dare ask him a question, you’ll miss dinner.  Though Ackerley doesn’t seem to mind.

·       Pigeon:  a player that is not a Member, who nonetheless joins in the playing of the game, is known as a pigeon.  Pigeons’ collective performances over the course of the season are also tracked on the spreadsheet for comparative purposes.

·       Spreadsheet:  the performance of each Member is tracked via spreadsheet over the course of an entire season.  It is from this tracking that the winner of the annual Pettit Trophy is determined.

·       The Weasel:  Vince Lanza.  Legendary.  Enough said.

·       The Wink-Wink Nod-Nod:  there are moments in which a player must decide whether to take an increased risk by going it alone (Pig), when really all he wants to do is increase the wager without invoking a double.  But in the 5-man and 6-man games, that risk can be mitigated by an Aardvark asking the Pig if he wants “insurance”.  The Pig is not supposed to know whether an Aardvark would provide such protection when making his decision.  But humans are corrupt from time to time, which leads to Aardvarks giving non-verbal cues to the Pig that he is willing to join him if the Pig risks going on his own.  An example of a non-verbal cue would be a wink, or even a nod (thus, the Wink-Wink Nod-Nod), which should be properly admonished by the rest of the playing group when it happens.  But it happens.


STRATEGIES

The amount of quarters one wins is more related to how well they bet, than how well they play.  And we’ll confess, there is a little bit of luck as well, such as falling onto the right team at the right times.  Here are some strategies, some agreed upon, some not, that can make the betting part of the game more successful:

·       When to double:  You don’t want to commit a Fuerst, which is to double too early only to have the tables turned on you in the end.  A safe double, usually, is when all players are on the green, within likely two-putt range, lying the same, and you are closest to the hole.  You wait ‘til the last player misses, then you double.  In this scenario the worst you should do is tie if you miss the putt.

o   If you think you have a likely birdie, when your opponents do not, you may want to double before they putt.  If you let them putt first, they’ll either tie the hole by making their putt, or they’ll turn down your double if they miss.

o   You are hitting fourth in the order and the first three players hit their tee shots out of bounds and the Captain asks you before you hit your tee shot.

o   Free Rein:  when your partner has completed the hole, and your opponents can’t beat him, you are said to have free rein over your putt to win the hole.  This is an obvious doubling opportunity, and your putt should never be short.

·       The Power of Big Numbers:  This is a concept often overlooked by the lowest handicap players in a group.  They tend to get overconfident when provided an opportunity to go solo.  Because their opponents may not have as impressive a handicap, they discount the power of having three balls competing against just one.

·       4th Man Roulette:  The captain should be wary of waiting until the 4th player in the order hits to select a partner.  His options are very limited and he may not like what he gets.

·       First in the Fairway:  To mitigate the suffering associated with 4th Man Roulette, the captain may be wise to simply choose the first player to put his tee shot in the fairway.

·       Cancellation Theory:  The captain should be wary about becoming a pig by not selecting a partner who is very likely to tie the hole with him.  The two players will merely tie the hole, or cancel each other out.  Neither player wins, and the other players who did not contribute get an undeserving benefit.

# Defensive Coding Standards (Wolf Goat Pig)

- Always initialize all class attributes in __init__ and after deserialization, even if to None or an empty value.
- Never use dict['key'] unless you are certain the key exists. Use a helper like _require_key(obj, key, context) for required keys, and _safe_get(obj, key, default) for optional keys. Log and raise a clear error if a required key is missing.
- Use Pydantic models for all API request bodies and responses. Validate all incoming data for required fields, types, and value ranges. Return clear, descriptive error messages for all 400s (bad requests).
- Wrap all database reads/writes in try/except blocks. Log all DB errors with context. On DB failure, return a safe fallback or error message—never crash.
- Check all preconditions before state transitions (e.g., is the game active? are all required fields set?). Log and return a clear error if a precondition fails.
- Use a FastAPI global exception handler to catch all unhandled exceptions. Return a JSON error with a unique error code and log the stack trace.
- Use the logging module for all warnings, errors, and info. Include context (user, endpoint, payload, state) in every log. For critical errors, log the full stack trace (traceback.format_exc()).
- Write tests that intentionally send bad/missing data to every endpoint and method. Assert that the response is a clear, descriptive error, not a crash or generic 500.
- Always check backend response status and error messages in the frontend. Never assume a request will succeed; handle and display errors gracefully. Disable UI actions that would trigger invalid backend calls.
- Document all possible error codes and messages for each endpoint. Use unique error codes for common failure modes (e.g., ERR_MISSING_FIELD, ERR_INVALID_STATE).
