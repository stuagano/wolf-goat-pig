### 2. API Integration Tests (`simulation-api.spec.js`)
Direct testing of backend API endpoints and data flow:

**Core API Functionality:**
- ✅ Setup simulation via API
- ✅ Fetch timeline after setup  
- ✅ Fetch poker-style betting state after setup
- ✅ Handle betting decisions
- ✅ Update poker betting phase as game progresses

**Timeline Event Tracking:**
- ✅ Play shots and track in timeline
- ✅ Track multiple shot events with timestamps
- ✅ Verify reverse chronological ordering
- ✅ Event structure validation

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Graceful API error responses
- ✅ Validation of required parameters
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes

## Key Features Tested

### Texas Hold'em Poker Integration
- **Betting Phases:** Pre-flop, Flop, Turn, River mapped to golf hole progression
- **Pot Calculation:** Dynamic pot size based on current wager and player count
- **Betting Options:** Check, Call, Raise, Fold, All-in (Go Solo) actions
- **Game State:** Proper tracking of doubled bets and wagering status

### Timeline Event System
- **Event Types:** Shot events, partnership formations, betting decisions
- **Chronological Ordering:** Events displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- **Event Filtering:** Filter by bets, shots, partnerships, or view all
- **Event Structure:** Consistent structure with description, timestamp, player, and details

### AI Player Behavior
- **Personalities:** Aggressive (Clive), Conservative (Gary), Strategic (Bernard)
- **Autonomous Decisions:** AI players make betting and partnership decisions independently
- **Variety:** Different AI players exhibit distinct playing styles

### Game Flow Integration
- **Setup Process:** Player configuration, AI opponent selection, course selection
- **Shot Progression:** Proper turn order and shot tracking
- **Scoring System:** Handicap calculations and stroke advantages
- **Hole Completion:** Full hole play through to completion

## Test Infrastructure

### Configuration
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3001` (configurable via `BASE_URL` env var)
- **API URL:** `http://localhost:8000` (configurable via `REACT_APP_API_URL`)
- **Browser:** Chromium (with support for Firefox, Safari, Mobile)
- **Timeouts:** 30 seconds default, extended to 60 seconds for full hole tests

### Test Organization
- **Modular Setup:** Reusable `setupAndStartGame()` functions
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of timeouts and failed assertions
- **Screenshots:** Automatic screenshots on failures for debugging
- **Parallel Execution:** Tests run in parallel for efficiency

### Key Fixes Implemented
1. **Splash Screen Handling:** Tests now handle the "Start New Game" splash screen
2. **CSS Selector Issues:** Fixed invalid `:nth()` selectors to use `.nth()` method
3. **API Endpoint Fixes:** Fixed poker state endpoint to use correct data structures
4. **Timeline Integration:** Verified timeline event collection and API responses

## Test Results Summary

### UI Tests (`simulation.spec.js`)
- **Total Tests:** 23 comprehensive UI workflow tests
- **Coverage:** Complete user journey from setup to hole completion
- **Key Scenarios:** Setup, game play, timeline display, poker betting, error handling

### API Tests (`simulation-api.spec.js`) 
- **Total Tests:** 8 focused API integration tests
- **Coverage:** Backend API functionality and data validation
- **Key Scenarios:** Setup, timeline tracking, poker state, betting decisions

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Complete Simulation Mode Testing
Successfully created end-to-end tests covering the full simulation experience from setup through hole completion.

### 2. Texas Hold'em Poker Integration Validation
Verified that the poker-style betting mechanics properly map golf progression to poker phases and provide appropriate betting options.

### 3. Timeline Event System Verification
Confirmed that all game events (shots, partnerships, betting) are properly tracked and displayed in reverse chronological order.

### 4. AI Player Behavior Testing
Validated that AI players with different personalities make autonomous decisions and exhibit distinct playing styles.

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
