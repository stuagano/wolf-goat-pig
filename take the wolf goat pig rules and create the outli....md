This is a fantastic and incredibly detailed set of rules for "Wolf Goat Pig" golf\! It's clear this is a deeply ingrained and cherished game with a rich history and a vibrant culture of banter.

Given the complexity, a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for a web application would need to focus on the absolute core mechanics for a **4-man game** to be achievable. Trying to implement all the rules (5-man, 6-man, Aardvarks, Ping Ponging, etc.) for an MVP would be a massive undertaking. The goal of an MVP is to get a functional, playable version out there quickly to gather feedback.

Here's an MVP outline and implementation steps, prioritizing the **4-man game** and the essential betting mechanics.

**Wolf, Goat, Pig Golf: MVP Web App Outline (4-Man Game Focus)**

The core purpose of this MVP is to allow four players to track their "Wolf, Goat, Pig" game, manage partnerships, record scores, and see point accrual based on a simplified set of rules.

**I. Core Game Logic & State Management (Backend or Robust Frontend)**

* **A. Player & Game Setup:**  
  * **Players:** 4 pre-defined players (for MVP, no user accounts).  
  * **Scorecard/Points:** A central object/array to track each player's net score for the hole and cumulative points (quarters) won/lost.  
  * **Current Hole State:**  
    * current\_hole\_number: (1-18)  
    * hitting\_order: Array of player IDs in current tee order.  
    * captain\_id: ID of the current hole's Captain.  
    * teams\_formed: Object/array indicating partnerships for the hole (e.g., {'Team A': \[player1\_id, player2\_id\], 'Team B': \[player3\_id, player4\_id\]} or {'Captain\_Solo': \[player1\_id\], 'Opponents': \[player2\_id, player3\_id, player4\_id\]}).  
    * base\_wager: Current quarter value for the hole (starts at 1, can be doubled by carry-over, float, or option).  
    * doubled\_status: Boolean, whether the bet has been doubled on the current hole.  
    * game\_phase: 'Regular' or 'Hoepfinger'.  
* **B. Core Rules Engine (Validation & Calculation):**  
  * **Tee Order Rotation:** Logic to rotate hitting\_order after each hole.  
  * **Captain Determination:** Automatically assign Captain based on rotation.  
  * **Partnership Formation:**  
    * Validate Captain's partner request (before next player hits).  
    * Validate partner acceptance/rejection.  
    * Logic for "On Your Own" (Pig).  
  * **Scoring & Point Calculation:**  
    * Input net scores for each player per hole.  
    * Determine winning/losing team based on best ball.  
    * Calculate points for the hole based on base\_wager, doubled\_status, "On Your Own" multiplier (2x base wager), and "Duncan" multiplier (3 for 2).  
    * Apply **Karl Marx Rule** for odd point distribution if needed.  
  * **Hoepfinger Logic:**  
    * Detect start of Hoepfinger (Hole 17 for 4-man).  
    * Identify "Goat" (player furthest down).  
    * Allow Goat to select hitting order spot.  
    * Apply **Joe's Special** rules for base wager (2, 4, or 8 quarters; no doubling until all tee shots).  
  * **Betting Convention Logic (Simplified for MVP):**  
    * **Carry-Over:** Double base wager for next hole if all teams halve (but not on consecutive holes).  
    * **Double:**  
      * Allow one team to offer a double to another.  
      * Handle acceptance (doubles stake) or rejection (offering team wins at prior stake).  
      * Prevent doubling while addressing ball.  
      * (Omit Ackerley's Gambit for MVP).  
    * **Float:** Allow Captain to invoke once per round to double base wager.  
    * **Option:** If Captain is "Goat," allow automatic double of base wager unless turned off.  
    * **Double Points Rounds:** Manually configurable setting for "Major" days.  
    * (Omit "Big Dick," "If at First you Do succeed" for MVP).  
* **C. Actions/Functions:**  
  * startGame(): Initialize all state.  
  * setTeeOrder(players): Randomly set initial order.  
  * captainRequestsPartner(captainId, requestedPartnerId): Captain action.  
  * playerAcceptsPartner(partnerId) / playerDeclinesPartner(partnerId): Partner action.  
  * captainGoesSolo(captainId): Captain action.  
  * offerDouble(offeringTeamId, targetTeamId): Betting action.  
  * acceptDouble(teamId) / declineDouble(teamId): Betting action.  
  * invokeFloat(captainId): Betting action.  
  * toggleOption(captainId): Betting action.  
  * recordNetScore(playerId, holeNetScore): After hole played.  
  * calculateHolePoints(): Determine points for current hole and update cumulative.  
  * nextHole(): Advance game, rotate Captain, apply carry-over, reset hole-specific state.  
  * restartGame(): Reset game state.

**II. User Interface (Frontend)**

* **A. Game Board Layout:**  
  * **Current Hole Display:** Large, clear display of current hole number.  
  * **Player List:** Display all 4 players with their current cumulative point totals (quarters).  
  * **Current Tee Order:** Visually show the hitting order for the current hole.  
  * **Team Display:** Clearly show the formed teams for the current hole (e.g., "Captain & Partner" vs. "Opponents," or "Captain Solo" vs. "Team of 3").  
  * **Scorecard:** A simple table to input net scores for each player per hole.  
  * **Game Status/Messages:** A prominent area for notifications (e.g., "It's \[Player Name\]'s turn to choose\!", "Invalid move," "Double offered\!", "You Win\!").  
* **B. Controls & Interaction:**  
  * **Captain's Choice:** Buttons for "Request Partner" (with player selection dropdown) and "Go Solo."  
  * **Partner's Response:** Buttons for "Accept Partnership" and "Decline Partnership."  
  * **Betting Actions:**  
    * "Offer Double" button (available to relevant teams).  
    * "Accept Double" / "Decline Double" buttons (available to target team).  
    * "Invoke Float" button (available to Captain once).  
    * "Toggle Option" checkbox/button (available to Captain if Goat).  
  * **Score Input:** Number input fields for each player's net score for the current hole.  
  * **Next Hole Button:** Becomes active once scores are entered and validated.  
  * "Restart Game" button.  
* **C. Visual Feedback:**  
  * Highlight the current Captain.  
  * Visually represent active teams.  
  * Dynamically update point totals.  
  * Display current base\_wager value.

**III. Application Architecture (MVP)**

* **Frontend-Only (Recommended for fastest MVP):**  
  * **Technology:** React, Vue.js, or Svelte (for component-based development and reactive UI updates). Vanilla JavaScript is also an option for absolute minimal setup but less maintainable.  
  * All game logic and state reside in the client's browser memory. No backend server needed for the MVP.  
  * This keeps development lean and focused on core functionality.

**Steps to Implement the MVP Web App**

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Game State**

1. **Project Initialization:**  
   * Create a new project using a chosen frontend framework (e.g., create-react-app my-wgp-app).  
   * Set up basic folder structure (e.g., components, utils, styles).  
2. **Define Static Data:**  
   * Create an array of player objects (e.g., \[{ id: 'p1', name: 'Bob' }, { id: 'p2', name: 'Scott' }, ...\]).  
3. **Initial Game State:**  
   * In your main application component (e.g., App.js in React), use state management (e.g., React useState or useReducer) to define the initial game\_state:  
     JavaScript  
     const \[gameState, setGameState\] \= useState({  
         players: \[...initialPlayerData\], // With cumulative points  
         currentHole: 1,  
         hittingOrder: \[\], // Will be randomized  
         captainId: null,  
         teams: {}, // E.g., { type: 'solo', captain: 'p1', opponents: \['p2', 'p3', 'p4'\] } or { type: 'partners', team1: \['p1', 'p2'\], team2: \['p3', 'p4'\] }  
         baseWager: 1, // Quarters  
         doubledStatus: false,  
         gamePhase: 'Regular',  
         holeScores: {}, // { 'p1': null, 'p2': null, ... }  
         gameStatusMessage: "Time to toss the tees\!",  
         playerFloatUsed: {}, // { 'p1': false, 'p2': false, ... }  
     });

4. **Tee Order Randomization:**  
   * Implement setTeeOrder() function to randomly assign initial hittingOrder and captainId at the start of the game. Call this on startGame().

**Phase 2: Core Game Logic (Functions to modify state)**

1. **Captain & Partnership Functions:**  
   * Write handleCaptainRequestPartner(captainId, requestedPartnerId):  
     * Updates teams in gameState to reflect the proposed partnership.  
     * Sets gameStatusMessage for the partner to respond.  
   * Write handlePartnerResponse(partnerId, accepted):  
     * If accepted: Finalize teams in gameState.  
     * If declined: Set teams for Captain solo vs. others, and double baseWager (onYourOwn rule).  
     * Update gameStatusMessage.  
   * Write handleCaptainGoSolo(captainId):  
     * Sets teams for Captain solo vs. others.  
     * Doubles baseWager.  
     * Update gameStatusMessage.  
2. **Betting Functions (Simplified):**  
   * handleOfferDouble(offeringTeamId, targetTeamId): Updates gameStatusMessage and doubledStatus (temporarily).  
   * handleAcceptDouble(teamId): Sets doubledStatus to true.  
   * handleDeclineDouble(teamId): Calculates points for the offering team at the *prior* stake, updates players cumulative points, and sets gameStatusMessage (hole ends).  
   * handleInvokeFloat(captainId): Doubles baseWager for current hole, marks float as used for that player.  
   * handleToggleOption(captainId): Logic to check if captain is Goat and double baseWager.  
3. **Score Input & Point Calculation:**  
   * Write handleRecordNetScore(playerId, score): Updates holeScores in gameState.  
   * Write calculateHolePoints():  
     * This is the most complex part. After all scores are entered:  
     * Determine best ball for each team based on holeScores.  
     * Compare best balls to determine winner.  
     * Apply baseWager, doubledStatus, "On Your Own" (2x), and "Duncan" (3 for 2\) multipliers to calculate raw points.  
     * Distribute points to players cumulative totals. **Crucially, implement the Karl Marx Rule here.**  
     * Check for "Carry-Over" condition (all teams halve). If true, set a flag for the *next* hole's baseWager.  
4. **Hole Advancement:**  
   * Write handleNextHole():  
     * Increment currentHole.  
     * Rotate hittingOrder for next hole.  
     * Determine new captainId.  
     * Reset teams, doubledStatus, holeScores.  
     * Apply any "Carry-Over" from previous hole to baseWager (and reset the carry-over flag).  
     * Check for **Hoepfinger** phase (Hole 17). If true, identify "Goat" and prompt for hitting order choice and apply **Joe's Special** rules for baseWager.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development (Rendering & Interaction)**

1. **Initial Screen:**  
   * A simple "Start Game" button.  
   * Displays initial player list with 0 points.  
2. **Game Board Component:**  
   * Create a main component to render the game state.  
   * **Player & Score Display:** Map gameState.players to display names and current point totals.  
   * **Tee Order Display:** Visually show the hittingOrder (e.g., numbered list of player names).  
   * **Current Hole Display:** Prominently show gameState.currentHole.  
   * **Team Display:** Conditional rendering based on gameState.teams to show who is partnered with whom.  
   * **Game Status Messages:** Display gameState.gameStatusMessage.  
3. **Controls & User Input:**  
   * **Captain's Actions:**  
     * Buttons for "Request Partner" and "Go Solo" visible only to the current Captain at the start of the hole.  
     * A dropdown/radio buttons to select a partner.  
   * **Partner's Actions:**  
     * "Accept" / "Decline" buttons visible only to the requested partner.  
   * **Betting Buttons:**  
     * "Offer Double": Visible to valid teams after partnerships are formed.  
     * "Accept Double" / "Decline Double": Visible to the target team after a double is offered.  
     * "Invoke Float": Visible to the Captain once per game.  
     * "Toggle Option": Visible to the Captain if they are the "Goat."  
   * **Score Input:** Input fields for each player's net score. A "Submit Scores" button to trigger calculateHolePoints().  
   * **Next Hole Button:** Only enabled after calculateHolePoints() is run and valid.  
   * **Restart Button:** Always visible.  
4. **Styling (CSS):**  
   * Use CSS to make the UI clear, readable, and functional. No need for elaborate visuals initially.  
   * Highlight active players or teams.

**Phase 4: Testing & Refinement**

1. **Thorough Manual Testing:**  
   * Play through multiple full 18-hole rounds.  
   * Test all partnership scenarios (solo, partnered, declining).  
   * Test all betting scenarios (doubles accepted/declined, float, option).  
   * Force "Carry-Over" to test its effect.  
   * Ensure **Karl Marx Rule** correctly distributes odd quarters.  
   * Test **Hoepfinger** phase, Goat selecting order, and **Joe's Special** wager logic.  
   * Verify point totals are correct after each hole.  
   * Test "Restart Game."  
2. **Edge Case Testing:**  
   * What happens if no scores are entered?  
   * What happens if an invalid partner is selected?  
   * What if a double is offered at the wrong time?  
3. **User Experience (UX) Tweaks:**  
   * Ensure clear instructions and feedback messages.  
   * Disable/enable buttons appropriately to guide the user.  
   * Make sure the flow from hole to hole is intuitive.  
   * Add simple animations or visual cues for state changes (e.g., points increasing).  
4. **Code Review & Refactoring:**  
   * Improve function naming and variable clarity.  
   * Break down complex functions into smaller, manageable ones.  
   * Add comments for intricate logic (e.g., Karl Marx, Hoepfinger calculations).

**Considerations for Future Expansion (Beyond MVP):**

* **Backend for Persistence:** If you want to save game history or allow players to resume games.  
* **User Accounts:** To track individual player stats across multiple games.  
* **More Game Sizes:** Implement 5-man and 6-man game rules, Aardvarks, Ping Ponging.  
* **Full Betting Conventions:** Add Ackerley's Gambit, Big Dick, "If at First you Do succeed."  
* **Handicaps & Creecher Feature:** Incorporate detailed handicap calculations.  
* **Admin Panel:** For setting Double Points Rounds or managing official members.  
* **Real-time Updates:** If multiple people want to view the game from different devices (requires websockets).

By focusing on the 4-man game and the core rules as outlined, you can achieve a functional MVP that accurately simulates the fundamental mechanics of Wolf, Goat, Pig golf, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
