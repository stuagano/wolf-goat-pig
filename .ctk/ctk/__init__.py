claude-test-kit (ctk)
=====================

A small, opinionated Python testing framework built to catch the specific way
agent/script work fails: it *claims* success but didn't actually do the thing.

Design goal: make silent failure impossible to ignore.

Four failure modes this kit is built to catch
----------------------------------------------
1. "Claude says done, isn't"  -> ctk.verify  (claim-vs-reality checks on real side effects)
2. No output validation       -> ctk.contracts (declarative checks on the actual output)
3. Swallowed exceptions       -> ctk.lint (AST scan) + no_error_logs fixture
4. Exit 0 but wrong output    -> ctk.runners (strict runner: exit code AND output asserted)

Quick start
-----------
    from ctk import run, expect, Artifact, verify

    # 1. Run a script strictly: exit code + output are both checked.
    r = run(["python", "my_tool.py", "--out", "result.json"])
    r.ok()                         # fails loudly if returncode != 0
    r.no_stderr_errors()           # fails if stderr looks like an error

    # 2. Validate the output actually matches what you expected.
    expect(r.stdout).nonempty().matches(r"Processed \d+ rows")

    # 3. Verify the agent's *claim* against reality.
    verify(
        Artifact("result.json", min_bytes=2, is_json=True, json_keys=["rows"]),
    )
