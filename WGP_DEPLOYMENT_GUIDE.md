# 🐺🐐🐷 Wolf Goat Pig Deployment Guide

## ✅ Current Status: DEPLOYMENT READY

The Wolf Goat Pig game and new features have been validated and are ready for both local development and hosted deployment.

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Vercel Deployment Issue
**Problem**: Vercel deployment was failing with "The `functions` property cannot be used in conjunction with the `builds` property"

**Solution**: Removed the conflicting `functions` section from `vercel.json`

```diff
- "functions": {
-   "frontend/build/**": {
-     "includeFiles": "frontend/build/**"
-   }
- }
```

### 2. Updated API URL Configuration
**Problem**: API URL was pointing to incorrect backend URL

**Solution**: Updated to correct Render backend URL:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "REACT_APP_API_URL": "https://wolf-goat-pig-api.onrender.com",
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Potential CORS issues between local and hosted environments

**Solution**: Added explicit CORS origins in `render.yaml`:

```yaml
- key: CORS_ORIGINS
  value: "https://wolf-goat-pig.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000"
```

## 🏠 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- Python 3.8+
- npm or yarn

### Frontend (Local)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Uses proxy configuration to `http://localhost:8000`
- No REACT_APP_API_URL needed (proxy handles it)

### Backend (Local)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
- Runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- CORS configured to allow all origins
- Database uses SQLite for local development

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Test Wolf Goat Pig functionality
python3 test_wolf_goat_pig.py

# Test deployment compatibility
python3 test_wgp_deployment.py

# Access the game
# Open browser to http://localhost:3000/wolf-goat-pig
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. **Connect GitHub**: Link your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://wolf-goat-pig-api.onrender.com`
3. **Deploy**: Push to GitHub main branch
4. **Verify**: Check `https://wolf-goat-pig.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Backend Deployment (Render)
1. **Connect GitHub**: Link your GitHub repo to Render
2. **Create Services**: Render will read `render.yaml` and create:
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Web service for API
3. **Environment**: All environment variables auto-configured
4. **Verify**: Check `https://wolf-goat-pig-api.onrender.com/health`

### Step 3: Test Complete System
1. **Access Game**: Go to `https://wolf-goat-pig.vercel.app/wolf-goat-pig`
2. **Test Features**:
   - ✅ Game setup (4/5/6 players)
   - ✅ Computer player configuration
   - ✅ Partnership formation
   - ✅ Betting mechanics
   - ✅ Shot progression
   - ✅ Score entry and game flow

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CORS Errors**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Backend configured with permissive CORS
- Allows all origins during development
- Specific origins configured for production

- ✅ **Fixed**: Correct Render URL configured
- Local: Uses proxy (no API_URL needed)
- Hosted: Uses `https://wolf-goat-pig-api.onrender.com`

**3. Build Failures**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Removed conflicting Vercel configuration
- Frontend builds successfully
- No dependency conflicts

**4. Game State Issues**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper JSON serialization
